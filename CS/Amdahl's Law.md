Speedup <= 1/(F + (1 -F)/N)

Where F is the fraction of computation that must be performed serially and N is the number of processors available. As N approaches infinity the maximum speed up converges to 1/F. If 50% of the work needs to be performed serially, from this formula we see that the maximum speed up we can gain is a factor of 2
