Interrupts:
* Generated by an external entity - I/O devices, timers, sockets etc
* The kind of interrupts that can be sent to a thread/process is hardware specific
* Interrupts are asynchronous

Signals:
* Generated by the CPU running software
* The different kinds of signals are OS specific
* Synchronous or asynchronous

Both Interrupts and Signals have Interrupt Handler and Signal Handler tables respectively. The table is used to look up the starting address for the handler routine for a signal/interrupt and that handler routine gets executed in the context of that thread.
