The runqueue (aka ready queue from which OS schedules tasks on the CPU) data structure is tightly coupled with the scheduling algorithm. 
Some trivial scheduling algorithm examples:
* FCFS (First-Come-First-Serve)
* Shortest Job First (To maximise throughput of the system)
* Complex Jobs first (To maximize utilization of the resources)
