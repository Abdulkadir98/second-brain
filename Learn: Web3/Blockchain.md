## Basics

### What is a block in Blockchain?

Blocks are **data structures within the blockchain database, where transaction data in a cryptocurrency blockchain are permanently recorded**. A block records some or all of the most recent transactions not yet validated by the network. Once the data are validated, the block is closed

#### Nonce
It is a number part of the block, which is a number that hashed along with the block number, the actual data, and other fields makes the hash field start with a certain prefix. The prefix is different for different blockchains (ethereum, bitcoin etc) but the idea is the same.

When miners mine they are solving the computationally intensive process of finding the nonce.

### Mining
The process of finding the "solution" to the blockchain "problem".
Nodes get paid for mining blocks
