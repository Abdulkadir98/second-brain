Intellij is a IDE (Integrated Development Environment) created by the company JetBrains. It is by far the most popular IDE for the Java ecosystem and also supports many other languages and frameworks such as Typescript, Python etc. In this section I want to talk about some of the handy shortcuts you can use to boost your productivity without having to take your hands off the keyboard.


#### Navigation
To jump to the class definition, method definition, or where a constant or a variable is defined- navigate the cursor to that piece of code and &#x2318; (cmd) + B. It is quick way to jump between the call site of a name and its definition.
- &#x2318; (cmd) `+` E - View recent files


#### Search
- Search for a symbol, file, action, tool window within a repository by hitting the shift key twice (&#x21E7; &#x21E7;)
- &#8963; ctrl ` + g` - Lets you find all occurrences of a particular string. Navigate your cursor to the string you wish to find and then enter this keyboard shortcut you will notice the cursor highlight the next occurrence of the string. Repeatedly hitting this shortcut will highlight all the occurrences and you can replace all of them at once by typing the string you with to replace it with

#### Editing
Some useful commands

- &#x2318; (cmd) ` + d` - duplicates the line. Useful when you want to add multiple lines that differ only in a small way
- &#x2325; option `+` &#x23ce; return - invokes the context action menu. Lets you easily fix errors, warnings. For e.g. missing import statements in Java etc
- &#8963; ctrl `+` &#x21E7; shift `+` l - reformat the whole file according to current code style settings
- &#x2318; (cmd) `+` `/` - To comment a line
- &#x2318; (cmd) `+` &#x21E7; shift `+` `/` - To uncomment a line
- &#x2325; option `+`&#8963; ctrl `+` O - To optimize import statements (remove unnecessary imports and order them lexicographically, useful if you have linter rules defined for your project)
